{"name":".dotfiles","body":"# dotfiles\r\n\r\nThis is a collection of dotfiles that should make your day to day work easier, if you see any errors or wish to contribute feel free to fork, open an issue\r\nor send a pull request.\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\n* `git clone git@github.com:cloverinteractive/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`\r\n* `cd ~/.dotfiles`\r\n* `bundle install`\r\n* `rake`\r\n\r\nYour original dotfiles will be renamed to `name.orig` so no worries.\r\n\r\n## Uninstall\r\n\r\n* `cd ~/.dotfiles`\r\n* `rake uninstall`\r\n\r\nAfterwards you can optionally `rm -fr ~/.dotifiles` if you wish, your `name.orig` files will be restored by having run `rake uninstall`.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) of course\r\n* [bundler](http://gembundler.com/)\r\n\r\n`gem install bundler`\r\n\r\n## Your Bash config isn't enough for me\r\n\r\nIt is likely you have defined functions or aliases not contained in this config and you are worried to upgrade and lose them, in order to kep them and load them\r\nyou only need to create a file named `.bash_profile.before` which will be loaded before our `.bash_profile` and a file named `.bash_profile.after` which will\r\nbe loaded after.\r\n\r\n## Upgrade single bits\r\n\r\nIf you already have dotfiles installed (all symlinks have been created) you can upgrade small bits like this:\r\n\r\n* `cd  ~/.dotfiles`\r\n* `git pull`\r\n* `rake bash # bash being the bit you wish to upgrade` \r\n\r\n## Commands that will make this enjoyable\r\n\r\n### OSX + macports\r\n\r\n* p5-app-ack\r\n* git-core\r\n* coreutils\r\n* vim\r\n* macvim\r\n* ruby\r\n* rb-rubygems\r\n* bash-completion\r\n* tmux\r\n\r\nYou can install each of this with a simple `port install <package>`.\r\n\r\n## Pry\r\n\r\nIf you install the pry gem the dotfiles config will give it access to the Rails stack so when in a rails project just run `pry` instead of `rails c`.\r\n\r\n## tmux bindings\r\n\r\nFor convenience we have changed the following to the `tmux` config:\r\n\r\n* To be consistent with `screen` (yeah I'm an old `screen` user) instead of binding the `tmux` prefix to `C-b` we prefix to `C-a`.\r\n* We binded `|` to `split-window -v`, it makes it more obvious you meant vertical split.\r\n* We binded `-` to `split-window -h`, it makes it more obvious you meant horizontal split.\r\n\r\n## issues\r\n\r\nThese dotfiles are still in the works and are not perfect, feel free to advise, fork and send your pull requests.\r\n","tagline":"","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
